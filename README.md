Collector designed to collect the World Bank datasets from the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/) website.

### Usage

    python run.py

You will need to have a file called .hdxkey in your home directory containing only your HDX key for the register script to run. That script was created to automatically register datasets on the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](http://data.humdata.org/) project.
